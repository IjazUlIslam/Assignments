# 33. In class, we discussed the logical operators and, or, and not. De Morgan‟s Laws can
# sometimes make it more convenient for us to express a logical expression. These laws
# state that the expression not(condition1 and condition2) is logically equivalent to the
# expression (not(condition1)or not(condition2)). Also, the expression not(condition1
# orcondition2) is logically equivalent to the expression (not(condition1)and
# not(condition2)). Use De Morgan‟s Laws to write equivalent expressions for each of the
# following, and then write a program to show that both the original expression and the
# new expression in each case are equivalent.
# a) not( x <5 ) and not( y >= 7 )
# b) not( a == b ) or not( g != 5 )
# c) not( ( x <= 8 ) and ( y >4 ) )
# d) not( ( i >4 ) or ( j <= 6 ) )
